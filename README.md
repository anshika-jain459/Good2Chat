Good2Chat(bot) is a fb messenger bot that helps you stay on top of your daily mental health.
Users complete the questionare about their daily activities, and also have a chance to journal their daily ventures. 
The information is agregated to a clean, light dashboard where they can see their daily health trends.
Users can also set an emergency word and contact, and their contact will be alerted of the user feeling unsafe if the emergency word is used.

I'm quite proud of this project! I learned plenty, targeted an issue I struggle with, and got some recognition along the way.

**Goals moving forward:**
- clean up the attrocious file structure
- integrate nlp to analyze the journal entry users provide
- find an alternative to ngrok so the app will always work, not just when I run the server on my machine
